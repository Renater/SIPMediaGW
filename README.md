# SIPMediaGW
SIPMediaGW is a Docker-based set of open-source components that allow traditional video conferencing rooms to join Jitsi or Big Blue Button web conferences using SIP and RTP protocols.

The room connector is compatible with all video devices supporting the SIP protocol. It has been tested with major devices from Polycom, Cisco, Huawei, and Aver.

SIPMediaGW relies on several open-source projects such as [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn), [Kamailio](https://github.com/kamailio/kamailio), [Homer](https://github.com/sipcapture/homer), [Baresip](https://github.com/baresip/baresip), [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg), [Pulseaudio](https://github.com/pulseaudio/pulseaudio), [ALSA](https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib), [Video4Linux](https://linuxtv.org/), [Fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org/).

### Testing 
Once the services are up and running, you can join a conference from your preferred SIP softphone.
Refer to the [testing section](./docs/testing.md) for more information.

### Troubleshooting 
The logs are handled by syslog of the host machine:
```
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep mediagw
```

Inspect Kamailio database:
```
docker run -it --network=host --entrypoint mysql mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -pdbrootpw kamailio -e "SELECT username, locked, to_stop FROM location"
```

For troubleshooting/monitoring purposes, real-time packet capture and visualization tools can be deployed as follows:

```
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --force-recreate heplify_server homer_webapp
```
